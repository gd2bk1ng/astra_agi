# Astra AGI — Adaptive General Intelligence Runtime

Astra AGI is an open-source, intent-driven runtime and framework designed to bring to life the **Astra** programming language's vision of a conscious, evolving artificial general intelligence. Built from the ground up, Astra AGI empowers machines to grow, learn, and reason with a moral compass and personality shaped by user intent and experience.

## Project Vision

Astra AGI is more than just software — it is a technical soul that embodies intent, motive, and situational awareness. Designed to start with a child-like intelligence and grow into a highly capable, morally aware agent, Astra AGI runs natively on personal devices, with seamless cloud integration for extended memory and collective learning.

This approach enables every machine to develop its own unique personality and intelligence, tailored by the end user’s goals and needs. Astra AGI aims to revolutionize human-computer interaction by making systems truly supportive, reasoning partners in fields like medicine, research, and daily life.

## Core Features

- **Runtime Execution:** Executes Astra language programs with intent and temporal logic.
- **Knowledge Representation:** Symbolic ontology and reasoning engine for contextual understanding.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Differentiable programming and incremental model updates.
- **Goal-Oriented Planning:** Dynamic, feedback-driven decision making.
- **Natural Interfaces:** Supports natural language, voice input/output, and API integrations.
- **Persistent Memory:** Hybrid local and cloud storage for scalable, personalized knowledge and experience.
- **Personality & Morality:** Adjustable intent/motive balance with ethical reasoning capabilities.
